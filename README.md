# CIS226
Alba Palacio.  
I am taking Python CIS 226 because I want to strengthen my programming skills and apply them to the field of cybersecurity. As I work toward my AAS in Cybersecurity, I see Python as a powerful tool that will allow me to automate tasks, analyze data, and better understand how systems and networks function. I am especially interested in learning how Python can be used for security testing and problem-solving, since those skills will be valuable in my future career.
